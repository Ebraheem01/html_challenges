    <h1> My HTML Experience </h1>

<!-- essay of what I have learned -->

    <font size= '5'>

        <p> This module has been very interesting so far, I've learned many new things. Before coming here I had no experience in HTML. </p>

        <p> I learned the simple HTML tags like the heading tags (h1 to h6 tags) with h1 being the largest tag and h2 being the smallest tag. The paragraph tag which is obviously for paragraphs, known as the p tag. I learned the list tags with the ul tag being an unordered list usually preceded by bulllets and the ol tag being an ordered list preceded by numbers. The text formating tags to add some style to your websites for example <b>boldness</b> (b) and <em>italics</em> (em). Adding images to give the websites more style. HTML tables are still best known for being used and abused to lay out pages. The correct use for tables is to do exactly what you would expect a table to do which is to structure tabular data. There is a number of tags used in tables, and to fully get to grips with how they work was probably the most challenging area of this module especially the nested tables.  Forms are used to collect data inputted by a user and this was very interesting to learn. They can be used as an interface for a web application, for example, or to send data across the web. Learning how to link things internally using jump links and linking externaly using hyperlinks. </p>

        <p>The challenges was very challenging I guess that's why it's called challenges, but it was very interesting because you could put everything you learned into practice. </p>
